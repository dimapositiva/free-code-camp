<p>Click the "Edit" page tab at the top of the page.
Make changes to the text.
Click the "Save page" button.
Simple as that!</p>

Editing rules, editing conventions, and formatting
The number one rule of wiki editing is to be bold. Go ahead - make changes. Other people can correct any mistakes you make, so have confidence, and give it a try! There are all kinds of editing conventions, rules, and philosophies for the editing of wiki pages, but the be bold rule is the most important of these!

An edit can contribute whole new paragraphs or pages of information, or it can be as simple as fixing a typo or a spelling mistake. In general, try to add or edit text so that it is clear and concise. Most importantly, make sure you are always aiming to do something which improves the contents of the wiki.

When you need to use some type of formatting, such as for new headings or bolding of text, you do this using wiki syntax or the buttons in the edit toolbar above the editing zone. See Help:Formatting for some of the common types of formatting used.

<h2>Edit summary</h2>
Before you save a change, you can enter a short note (must be shorter than 500 characters) in the "Summary (?):" box describing your changes. Don't worry too much about this, or spend too much time thinking about it: just put in a short description of what you just changed. For example, you might say "fixed typo" or "added more information about sunflowers".

This summary gets stored alongside your edit, and allows people to track changes in the wiki more effectively.

<h2>Preview</h2>
It's a good idea to use the "Show preview" button to see what your change will look like, before you save it. This is also related to tracking changes because every time you save, this is displayed to others as a separate change. This isn't something to worry about too much, but it's good to get into the habit of eliminating mistakes in your own work, by using a preview before saving, rather than saving, then having to do another edit just to make one or more minor corrections.

<h2>Show changes</h2>
Another option is the "Show changes" button which allows you to see the differences between the current version and the edited version.

<h2>Protected pages</h2>
Pages that are protected cannot be edited by anyone except users of a specific group. Protected pages will instead display "View source" instead of edit. In that case, to edit a protected page, contact a user who has permission to edit the page. The default protection levels are as follows:

</h2>None (allow all users)</h2>
Autoconfirmed (block new and unregistered users)
Sysop (block all users except administrators)
Other types of editing
With wiki edits you can start a new page, move (or rename) a page, or even delete a page:

<h2>Help:Starting a new page</h2>
Help:Moving a page
Help:Sysop deleting and undeleting
Remember you should always aim to improve the overall contents of the wiki with your edits.

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Every article has its own "talk page" where you can ask questions, make suggestions, or discuss corrections. See Help:Talk pages.</p>

      ou can format your text by using wiki markup. This consists of normal characters like asterisks, apostrophes or equal signs which have a special function in the wiki, sometimes depending on their position. For example, to format a word in italic, you include it in two pairs of apostrophes like ''this''.

Preformatted text
 Start each line with a space.
 Text is '''preformatted''' and
 ''markups'' '''''can''''' be done.
This way of preformatting only applies to section formatting. Character formatting markups are still effective.

Preformatted text blocks
 <nowiki>Start with a space in the first column,
(before the <nowiki>).

Then your block format will be
    maintained.

This is good for copying in code blocks:

def function():
    """documentation string"""

    if True:
        print True
    else:
        print False</nowiki>
Start with a space in the first column,

def function():
    """documentation string"""

    if True:
        print True
    else:
        print False

Paragraphs
MediaWiki ignores single line breaks. To start a new paragraph, leave an empty line. You can force a line break within a paragraph with the HTML tag <br />.

HTML tags
Some HTML tags are allowed in MediaWiki, for example <code>, <div>, and <span>. These apply anywhere you insert them.

Inserting symbols
Symbols and other special characters not available on your keyboard can be inserted in a multitude of ways. Many Operating Systems and browsers allow you to insert special characters through a menu option or Operating System panel. Additionally, you can use the WikiEditor or VisualEditor to insert them into the edit screen.

As a last resort, you can use a special sequence of characters. Those sequences are called HTML entities. For example, the following sequence (entity) &rarr; when inserted will be shown as right arrow HTML symbol → and &mdash; when inserted will be shown as an em dash HTML symbol —.

Hover over any character to find out the symbol that it produces. Some symbols not available in the current font will appear as empty squares.

See the list of all HTML entities on the Wikipedia article List of HTML entities. Additionally, MediaWiki supports two non-standard entity reference sequences: &רלמ; and &رلم; which are both considered equivalent to &rlm; which is a right-to-left mark. (Used when combining right to left languages with left to right languages in the same page.)

HTML tags and symbol entities displayed themselves (with and without interpreting them)
&amp;euro;  → &euro;
<span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">Typo to be corrected</span>  → Typo to be corrected
&lt;span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">Typo to be corrected</span>  → <span style="color: red; text-decoration: line-through;">Typo to be corrected</span>
Nowiki for HTML
<nowiki /> can prohibit (HTML) tags:

<<nowiki />pre>  → <pre>
But not & symbol escapes:

&<nowiki />amp;  → &
To print & symbol escapes as text, use "&amp;" to replace the "&" character (eg. type "&amp;nbsp;", which results in "&nbsp;").
